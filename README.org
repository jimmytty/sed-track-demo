* Sed Track Demos

This repository contains some demos with solutions and test cases from existing exercises.

Those demos use /GNU Sed extensions/ and /ERE - Extended Regular Expression/ to use full capabilities and less escapes ("~\~") in /regexps/.

To test these demos just clone this repository and, for each directory, run:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :results none
  cd <directory-name>
  bats test-*.bats
#+END_SRC

Alternatively, you can check solution with the script

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :results output
  ./test_them_all.sh
#+END_SRC
